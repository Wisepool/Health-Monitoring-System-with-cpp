# Mental Health Monitoring Using Circular Queue

## Data Structure Used
- **Queue (Circular Queue)**

## Abstract
Keeping track of mental health issues, like anxiety or depression, is crucial for getting the right support and treatment. However, many traditional methods struggle to provide timely updates and personalized care.

To solve this problem, we propose using a straightforward tool called a **circular queue** to monitor and manage symptoms in real-time.

Think of a circular queue as a rotating list that keeps the most recent entries while pushing out older ones. Imagine a round table where you place notes about symptoms as they come in. When new notes are added, the older ones are moved off the table to make space. This way, you always have the latest information right in front of you.

In practical terms, this means that as people report their symptoms through an app or device, these updates are quickly added to the system. The circular queue ensures that the system is always up-to-date with the most recent symptoms while efficiently managing the flow of information.

By doing so, the system helps healthcare providers quickly notice any significant changes in a person’s mental health. This allows for faster and more accurate adjustments to treatment plans.

Using this circular queue approach makes monitoring mental health more effective and responsive. It’s a simple but powerful way to ensure that support is timely and tailored to each person's current needs — demonstrating how even basic data structures can make a meaningful impact in healthcare.
